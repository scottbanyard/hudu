# Hudu
Hudu is an Android Application that allows a global population scale tracking of an individual’s self-reported symptoms of Post-Traumatic-Stress-Disorder (PTSD). This was created for researchers in the University of Bristol Psychology Department.

### Installation
- The .apk can be downloaded via our [Analytic Tool](https://myday.firebaseapp.com/ "Hudu's Analytic Tool").
- Give permission for the download to be installed on your mobile device.

### Features
- Secure. We are using Firebase to provide secure user login and password management, session timeouts, and database storage.
- Offline Capabilities. If you are not connected to the internet, the application will still work by saving to a file and keeping track of your submissions. When it finally does connect, it will send all the data to Firebase and clean the file.
- Notifications. Ensuring high user compliance is essential for the validity of any study. Our discrete notification system reminds users only if they’ve not entered a time slot.  
- Bilingual. The Psychology department have asked us to focus on Syrian refugees, many of whom cannot speak English, but instead speak Arabic (85% of population). We have therefore ensured the application can provide a quick swap between English and Arabic.
- User Feedback. Once a record is made, feedback will be given to show you that you have submitted this via our logo driven UI.

# Analytic Tool
Perfectly complementing the Hudu application, we also have an analytic tool that is simple and secure.

### Features
- Secure. User authentication via Firebase enables only individuals who have signed up to the application to login.
- Adaptable. Both administrators (for example, researchers) and Hudu users can utilise it, in which the administrators can view all users, but a user can only view their own records.
- Scalability. Administrators can track all users as a whole with one click of a button. The value represents the sum of flashbacks from each Hudu user on that certain date. It will show how many flashbacks there have been per day.
- Exportation. All the data can also be downloaded readily if needed.
- Track Individually. Administrators can focus on a certain Hudu user and can analyse two graphs -  the total number of flashbacks per day for that user, and how many flashbacks they had per morning, afternoon and evening per day.
- Clear. Using graphs will allow researchers to see patterns easily and analyse certain times of day.
- User Progress / Feedback. Users can login and see their own graphs with their recorded submissions.
- Admin Dashboard. Administrators with the correct permissions can create and remove other administrators with ease.
